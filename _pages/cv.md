<p style="font-size: 2em; font-weight: bold;">Alvio Yunita Putri / Curriculum Vitae</p>
[alvio.yunita1997@gmail.com](mailto:alvio.yunita1997@gmail.com)

[//]: # (I am an assistant professor at MBZUAI. I obtained my Ph.D. from the University of Edinburghâ€™s Institute for Language, Cognition, and Computation, where I focused on enhancing the training and inference speed of machine translation. My studies were supervised by Dr. Kenneth Heafield and Dr. Rico Sennrich. Presently, my research centers on multilingual, low-resource, and low-compute NLP. I have worked on lightweight models via distillation, as well as adapting models to unseen languages in cases of limited training data.)
[//]: # (I have been developing various multilingual large language models such as BLOOMZ/mT0, Jais, Bactrian-X, and more. I have also worked on building multilingual and under-represented NLP resources and benchmarks, especially those that capture local culture and nuances, some of which were awarded best resource papers.)
[//]: # (In the past, I have gained industry experience at companies such as Amazon, Google, and Apple.)
