# Teaching Statement

My approach to academic teaching is fundamentally rooted in my
background in competitive programming, first as a participant and later
as a coach. In 2007, I started my coding journey and I was fortunate to
win a medal at the national level in 2008, followed by a [silver medal
in IOI 2010](https://stats.ioinformatics.org/people/132), one of the
most prestigious coding competitions internationally. In 2008, I led the
coding club in my high school, often coaching my friends and juniors.
This continued during my undergraduate studies, where I trained peers
and juniors specifically for competitions.

Training for a competition is intensive and often requires long periods
of learning. This experience taught me that engaging teaching is a must;
maintaining students’ motivation is key to better learning outcomes. In
competitions, our goal is for the student not only to know high-level
ideas but to deeply understand the algorithm so that they can actually
implement it.

This paradigm carries over to my academic teaching. I try to deep-dive
into topics rather than just giving a high-level overview. Since
mathematical formulas can be intimidating, I prioritize detailed
diagrams to build intuition first. However, I still deep dive into every
specific component of that diagram. Whether it is the attention head in
a Transformer, the rank decomposition in LoRA, or the loss function in
Knowledge Distillation, I ensure students understand the mechanism
rather than treating it as a black box. I want students to be able to
employ the algorithms, not just discuss them. This approach is reflected
in my course reviews, where students noted that I can explain complex
concepts in "newbie terms" yet remaining technically rigorous, as
reflected by students as being "technical".

I also ensure that the teaching is interactive and engaging. I strive to
make the classroom less intimidating by incorporating humor and keeping
the mood light. I design assessments that are fun and interactive. For
example, in my recent graduate courses, I replaced standard final
presentations with a poster session, mimicking a real academic
conference where students actively discussed their work. For the
upcoming undergraduate Algorithms course, I am designing a competitive
multiplayer game framework where students will implement algorithms to
control agents that fight against one another.

Finally, I try to personalize the learning experience to engage more
with the students. I often ask questions to benchmark understanding and
adapt if topics have not yet been mastered. I check the student’s status
and provide extra sessions for those who need more help. For instance,
in NLP801 (2023) and NLP702 (2024), I noticed that some students
struggled with coding, particularly those coming from non-computer
science backgrounds. To address this, I organized extra hands-on
tutorials specifically on Python and PyTorch.

## MBZUAI Teaching

<div class="run-in-section" markdown="1">

**NLP801 - 2023** I joined MBZUAI right when the NLP department was
formed and was appointed as the main instructor for NLP801, an
introductory course for PhD students. Since the course was new, I had to
design it from scratch, with the help of Thamar Solorio. As the program
was new, we only had 6 students. I designed the course with the
assumption that the PhD students were already familiar with NLP basics;
hence, it was more advanced from the get-go and focused on discussions
of current trends. However, along the way, I noted that some students
had zero background in NLP, which required me to adjust the teaching on
the go. This provided a learning opportunity to improve my upcoming
teaching.

<div class="run-in-section" markdown="1">

**NLP702 - 2024** In the next term, I was tasked to co-instruct NLP702,
a master-level course on advanced NLP covering modern topics such as
transformers. However, I was not the lead instructor and taught only a
minority of the sessions. Note that at MBZUAI, courses are often taught
by multiple lecturers. Unfortunately, this course received mixed
feedback. While students expressed concerns about the depth and
repetitiveness of the material in the broader course, the feedback for
my specific sessions was excellent. In fact, the course evaluations
explicitly suggested that I should take on a larger portion of the
teaching load.

<div class="run-in-section" markdown="1">

**NLP702 / NLP806 - 2025** In the next term, I was trusted to take the
lead on NLP702. The class was combined with PhD students (NLP806), so
the class size was even larger. I updated the materials to remove
redundancy and to include more recent advancements, such as State-Space
Models, and more practical advancements in distributed training of Large
Language Models, interpretability, and more. I also taught the majority
of the sessions. Feedback improved significantly from the previous year
and the students were generally positive about the course. My personal
teaching feedback also improved.

### Teaching Feedback

The following is my course feedback, and it shows that the students
gradually increases. It also shows the improvement from NLP702 after I
took the lead and improve the course. I also highlight positive
feedback, including comments that students submitted in the negative
feedback section.

been incredibly refreshing, especially given how technically strong he
is. As someone with massive impostor syndrome, this normalization of not
knowing everything is really important and helpful and I find myself
less likely to try to cover my own tracks with dodgy answers when
someone asks me a question I can’t answer.</td>

## Advising and Mentoring

My group organization is primarily flat. Students, postdocs, and
assistants can easily come to my office or ping me via Slack or Discord
to discuss any topic. Likewise, collaboration is encouraged; I urge them
to discuss ideas with one another rather than working in isolation.
Students frequently drop by my office to discuss research or simply to
chat. This structure ensures I remain involved in all research projects
and hands-on with many of them. I strive to avoid a purely managerial
role where the research details are obscured, or letting the group
become so hierarchical that I lose touch with my students’ work.

To date, I have advised 5 PhD students, 9 MSc students, and several
research assistants and visitors. I have supervised one postdoc, and
another is joining soon. Within the MBZUAI NLP department, this
represents a significant group size, particularly for an Assistant
Professor.

Beyond MBZUAI, I actively collaborate with and advise external students,
primarily BSc and MSc students from Universitas Indonesia and ITB,
totaling 15 students so far. Several of these students have continued
their studies at MBZUAI; I view this as a valuable investment in the
talent pipeline that also allows me to contribute back to my country.
While maintaining a flat structure, I encourage PhD candidates to mentor
master’s or undergraduate students to develop their own mentorship
skills, though I remain actively involved in these projects as well.

My expectations for PhD students extend beyond the completion of a
thesis. My goal is to mold them into exceptional researchers equipped to
secure strong positions after graduation. Consequently, my mentorship
goes beyond technical supervision. We frequently discuss career strategy
and professional growth to ensure they are fully prepared for the field.

I do not demand a specific number of publications, though I do expect
students to publish to avoid the "red flag" of a zero-publication track
record. However, publication count is not the main focus. In an era
where tens of thousands of papers are submitted each cycle, adding one
more unrecognized paper is of limited value. Instead, I ask my students
to aim for influential and impactful work, even if it is only one single
paper.

While impact is harder to quantify, I define success through indicators
such as community discussion, dataset or model adoption
(downloads/usage), and citations by other influential works. I believe
that this approach is far more valuable than accumulating dozens of
unrecognized publications in a sea of papers.

I recognize the critical importance of internships. Securing an
internship at a top tech company or reputable research lab is a
mandatory requirement for the members of my group. I actively assist
students by providing internal references to tech companies and
connecting them with colleagues at various institutes. In addition, I
support them with CV review and interview preparation when necessary.

## Future Teaching and Mentoring Plan

One of the challenges of teaching at a relatively new university is the
limited number of students. Nevertheless, I see MBZUAI growing rapidly
and having more students in the near future, so I am very happy to
advise more PhD and MSc students from MBZUAI.

In terms of teaching, I will continue to teach NLP702/NLP806 at MBZUAI.
MBZUAI has also grown as a university and now we have our first cohort
of undergrads of around 100 students. The university trusts me to lead
teaching this first cohort on Algorithms and Data Structures and
Algorithms in 2026.

Beyond that, I am proactively building an undergraduate team to compete
in the ICPC, a highly prestigious international university-level
competition in competitive programming. I recruited 15 top students and
organized several selection contests. I now have 2 teams, each
consisting of 3 students, and I am coaching them for the ICPC regional
contest this coming December. Although ICPC training and DSA are not
closely related to NLP, this work has been especially rewarding because
it reconnects me with my long-standing passion for algorithms and
coding.
