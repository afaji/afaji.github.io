I am an assistant professor at MBZUAI. My current research area is multilingual, low-resource, and low-compute natural language processing. I also work on machine translation. If you are interested in these areas, I have multiple openings.

## Short Bio
I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Edinburgh, with Dr. Kenneth Heafield and Dr. Rico Sennrich as my supervisors. I have experience working in industry at companies such as Amazon, Google, and Apple. My Ph.D. research focused on improving the training and inference speed of machine translation, but my interests have since expanded to include broader issues in multilingual natural language processing, particularly in contexts where data and computational resources are limited. I am currently co-organizing community research movement of Indonesian NLP with the goal to push progress of NLP research of Indonesian languages.
