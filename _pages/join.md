Please note that if we have worked together in some capacity in the past, I would be happy to write a recommendation for you!

### Postdocs / Internships / Visiting Researchers / Research Assistant:

I am currently not hiring any postdoc/internship.

### Research from Indonesia:

I'm open to collaborating with students from outside MBZUAI on projects that align with my areas of interest (See my past co-advisees). You don't need to have prior research experience, but a good understanding of NLP and AI, as well as solid technical skills is important. What I look for in students is a strong interest in pursuing research, with the aim of creating impactful scientific work.

If you are interested, you may ask your primary supervisor to co-advise and pitch your proposal to me. We can discuss more.
