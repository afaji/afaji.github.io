<h2 id="service-for-institution">Service for Institution</h2>

<p>have prioritized service to my institution and the NLP department
through various roles, contributing significantly to the academic and
research environment at MBZUAI. Since joining, I have examined 5 PhD
candidacy exams (for 2nd-year students) and 9 master’s thesis defenses,
serving not only my own NLP department but also students from the ML
department. Notably, when the NLP department produced its first PhD
graduate in 2025, I was honored to serve as one of the examiners.</p>

<p>Regarding curriculum standards, I served on the 1st-year PhD
Qualification Exam committee in 2023 and 2025, tasked with writing and
grading exams. Relatedly, I contributed to the MBZUAI online admission
exams, which cover coding, math, and basic ML. In 2023, I evaluated the
question pools to flag incorrect or ambiguous items, and in 2025, I
served on the committee responsible for renewing the pool with a fresh
set of questions. I find exam committee work intellectually rewarding,
as it consistently refreshes my own foundational understanding.</p>

<p>In a more extensive capacity, I served on the NLP Admission Committee in
2024/2025 alongside Thamar Solorio, where we managed applications by
reviewing CVs and interviewing candidates. For the 2025/2026 cycle, I am
serving as the Chair for both the NLP and the new Undergraduate
admission committees. In this role, I have revised and streamlined the
process to ensure consistency and scalability; this involved designing
clear guidelines for committee decision-making and updating interview
protocols.</p>

<p>Additionally, I served as a faculty advisor for the <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/training_program/executive-program/">MBZUAI Executive
Education
Program</a> (MEP)
Cohort 4 in summer 2023. The MEP is a 5-month training initiative for
leaders in industry and the public sector, culminating in an AI capstone
project. My role involved guiding participants through their learning
journey and providing feedback on their proposals. Beyond these roles, I
have contributed through institutional talks, including student
orientation for internships and sessions on industry vs. academia
career.</p>

<h2 id="service-for-scientific-community">Service for Scientific Community</h2>

<p>Beyond institutional service, I contribute to the broader academic and
research communities. I have served as a reviewer and area chair for
top-tier conferences such as ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, ICLR, NeurIPS, and ACL
Rolling Review, as well as several workshops. In 2025, I served as a
member of COLING 2025 local chairs, whose job is to find sponsor, venue,
local attraction, and other relevant stuff in Abu Dhabi.</p>

<p>I have also actively engaged with the NLP community, mostly relevant to
my research direction and my research communities, by giving talks and
keynotes at major conferences, including ACL, NAACL, EMNLP and COLING.
My presentations primarily focus on inclusive data collection and
multilingualism, with keynotes delivered at workshops such as WiNLP,
CLTW, CALCS, and Field Matters. Furthermore, I have contributed to
community building and technical education through the SEACrowd Birds of
a Feather session at ACL 2024 and by teaching efficient model training
techniques at the Mexican NLP Summer School during NAACL 2024.</p>

<p>I have also organized several workshops to support research in
underrepresented areas. I organized <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2023.sealp-1.0/">SEALP
2023</a> and <a href="https://sealp-workshop.github.io/program/">SEALP
2025</a>, a workshop series
dedicated to Southeast Asian languages, and I organized <a href="https://melt-workshop.github.io/cfp/">MELT
2025</a>, a new workshop focused on
multilingual NLP, co-located in COLM. Currently, I am organizing the
<a href="https://multilingual-multicultural-evaluation.github.io/">Multilingual Multicultural
Evaluation</a>
workshop for EACL 2026.</p>

<p>Beyond workshops, I also organized several SemEval shared tasks, as I
find the creation of robust datasets and benchmarks to be a particularly
rewarding aspect of research. In 2024, I helped organize <a href="https://github.com/semantic-textual-relatedness/Semantic_Relatedness_SemEval2024">Task
1</a>,
which focused on measuring semantic relatedness for African and Asian
languages, and <a href="https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/SemEval2024-task8">Task
8</a>, which challenged
participants to detect machine-generated text across different domains.
In 2025, I co-organized <a href="https://github.com/emotion-analysis-project/SemEval2025-Task11">Task
11</a>,
focusing on emotion detection for low-resource languages. These
community challenges were well-received, <strong>attracting arond 160, 280,
and 800 participants</strong>, respectively.</p>

<h2 id="service-for-grassroots-nlp-community">Service for Grassroots NLP Community</h2>

<p>Indonesia has the 4th largest population in the world, yet it has
historically been underrepresented in global research, including NLP.
When I noticed a surge of Indonesian NLP activity around 2020, I was
highly encouraged. I began collaborating with local researchers, which
led to several joint projects and papers. As our network grew, I started
connecting with researchers across the broader Southeast Asian region
who faced similar challenges. We began collaborating on regional
resources and papers, further widening our circle.</p>

<p>Our largest collaborative work thus far was SEACrowd, a dataset catalog
for the region, which was inspired by NusaCrowd, an Indonesian variant
on which we previously worked with the Indonesian NLP community. As we
grew even bigger, we established the <a href="https://seacrowd.org/">SEACrowd</a>
(Yes, the same name as the project’s name), a non-profit organization to
host researchers interested in the region and foster collaboration on
meaningful projects. I currently serve on the Advisory Board and remain
actively involved. We organize Birds-of-a-Feather sessions at major
conferences and host our own workshop,
<a href="https://sealp-workshop.github.io">SEALP</a>. We also work on collaborative
initiatives; currently, we are building a Southeast Asian
Vision-Language Model.</p>

<p>Since 2024, SEACrowd also runs an <a href="https://seacrowd.org/apprenticeship.html">apprenticeship
program</a> where junior
researchers work on projects mentored by senior members, aiming to train
the next generation of scientists. In the pilot batch, we had 3 projects
where I was also a mentor. We learned valuable lessons from this pilot.
Specifically, the need to manage project scope, as overambitious goals
caused some students to lose momentum, and the importance of reducing
team size to keep it focused. We are now opening the second batch, the
first to involve public registration and I am happy to serve as a mentor
again.</p>

<p>Personally, I find SEACrowd to be a vital community. It also has
effectively become a talent pipeline for my group, with several Research
Assistants and students joining MBZUAI through this network. Even beyond
recruitment, it provides extensive networking opportunities, and I
frequently involve my lab in SEACrowd collaborative projects.</p>

<h2 id="service-for-olympiads-and-competitive-programming-community">Service for Olympiads and Competitive Programming Community</h2>

<p>Competitive programming has played a huge role in my career. I started
practicing in 2007, which led to a Silver Medal at the International
Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) in 2010. This achievement gave me a head
start in computer science and the privilege of scholarships for my
studies abroad. Grateful for these opportunities, I have dedicated many
years to giving back to the community.</p>

<p>I started coaching early, leading clubs during my high school and
undergraduate years. In 2008, I started teaching my high school
classmates for competition preparation. I have since trained several
competitive programming teams, including Indonesia’s national team
(2011–2013), the University of Edinburgh’s ICPC team (2014), and Saudi
Arabia’s national team for IOI (2020). In 2017, I co-wrote a
<a href="https://toki.id/buku-pemrograman-kompetitif-dasar/">book</a> and created
<a href="https://tlx.toki.id/courses">online training materials</a> that are now
used as the official preparatory course for Indonesia’s National
Olympiad. Currently, I am training the first batch of MBZUAI
undergraduates for the ICPC. We are aiming for the World Finals, and I
believe we can achieve this even as first-year students.</p>

<p>Designing interesting and challenging problems is not trivial,
regardless of whether it is for standard algorithms or AI competitions.
It requires constructing comprehensive test cases, writing reference
solutions, and verifying that the intended approach is correct. I have
contributed as a problem-setter for various algorithmic competitions,
including Indonesia’s National Olympiad (2013–2015) and <a href="https://icpc.global/ICPCID/XYTDHW4JI15A">multiple ICPC
events</a>. In fact, an <a href="https://apac.icpc.global/assets/competition/problemset.pdf#page=23">ICPC
problem</a>
I designed for the 2025 competition was inspired by the extremely long
Gala Dinner queue at EMNLP 2024.</p>

<p>I was also appointed to the Scientific Committee of several prestigious
competitions. Our responsibilities included ensuring that the problem
sets were fair and challenging, testing solutions, writing post-contest
editorials, and overseeing the competition in general. Specifically, I
served on the scientific committees for several national-level contests
in Indonesia in 2016 and 2017. I also served for <a href="https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/59727">TOKI-Open
2018</a>, a contest used to select
Indonesia’s IOI representatives which is also open to international
participants. Furthermore, I served on the Host Scientific Committee for
<a href="https://ioi2022.id/data/ioi-2022-hsc-report.pdf#page=9">IOI 2022</a>.</p>

<p>As AI becomes more prominent globally, it has become a recognized
olympiad field (IOAI). I served as a problem setter and jury member for
the 2025 IOAI in Beijing. Similarly, I co-organized Indonesia’s first
pilot of the National AI Olympiad in 2025 together with some members of
the informatics olympiad community. My role involved designing problems,
evaluating solutions, and organizing both the online qualification and
on-site finals. Looking ahead, I will continue this work as a member of
the Host Scientific Committee for the IOAI 2026 in Abu Dhabi.</p>

<p>I am happy to be involved in this community and plan to continue doing
so. I personally find that the rigor of competitive programming
significantly enhanced my technical skills and helped me secure jobs
before joining academia. While this might seem separate from my NLP
career, I am happy to continue contributing in this area. Furthermore,
the fields are actually becoming more connected now that we have the AI
Olympiad. Additionally, recent AI and LLM research frequently uses IOI
problems as a benchmark for reasoning capabilities.</p>
