I'm an NLP research scientist at Amazon. I did my PhD and post-doctoral at the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of Dr. Kenneth Heafield and Dr. Rico Sennrich. I'm interested in efficient NLP (to make light-weight/fast models) or low-resource NLP (transfer learning, data generation and construction).

### Education

- PhD, Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation, University of Edinburgh. (2016 - 2020)  
  Supervised by Dr. Kenneth Heafield and Dr. Rico Sennrich.  
  Thesis: [Approximating Neural Machine Translation for Efficiency](https://era.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1842/37232/Aji2020.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)
  
- MSc in Artificial Intelligence, University of Edinburgh (2014 - 2015)

### Other Stuff

#### Competitive Programming

I did [competitive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming) in my high school and undergrad days. I participated and won a silver medal at [the IOI](https://ioinformatics.org/) 2010. I also participated in several regional [ACM-ICPC](https://icpc.global/) contests and participated in the ACM-ICPC world final 2014.

Now I am helping the Indonesian computer olympiad team by compiling teaching materials such as [competitive programming course](https://tlx.toki.id/courses/) or [basic competitive programming book](https://toki.id/buku-pemrograman-kompetitif-dasar/) (in Indonesian), which are targeted at high school students. Apart from that I sometimes write competitive programming questions for various contests.
