I am doing NLP research at [Kata.ai](https://kata.ai) as a senior research scientist and at [the University of Edinburgh](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) as a Post-doctoral Research Associate. Previously, I did my PhD at the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of Dr. Kenneth Heafield and Dr. Rico Sennrich.

My research interest is in the Machine Translation area. I am interested in developing an efficient MT system, for example producing a smaller model or faster, or a shorter training time. Besides that, I am also interested in developing low-resource MT, or using MT for low-resource NLP.

### Other Stuff

#### Competitive Programming

I did [competitive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming) in my high school and undergrad days. I participated and won a silver medal at [the IOI](https://ioinformatics.org/) 2010. I also participated in several regional [ACM-ICPC](https://icpc.global/) contests and participated in the ACM-ICPC world final 2014.

Now I am helping the Indonesian computer olympiad team by compiling teaching materials such as [competitive programming course](https://tlx.toki.id/courses/) or [basic competitive programming book](https://toki.id/buku-pemrograman-kompetitif-dasar/) (in Indonesian), which are targeted at high school students. Apart from that I sometimes write competitive programming questions for various contests.
